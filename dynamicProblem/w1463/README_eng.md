# problem
- There are three operation in order to make a given number to 1. Now, we will use these operations properly then the count of operation called should be minimum.

# condition
- operation(1) : If the number(X') could be divided by 3, then divide it.
  X' = X' / 3;
- operation(2) : If the number(X') could be divided by 2, then divide it.
  X' = X' / 2;
- operation(3) : Substract 1 from the the number(X').
  X' = X' - 1;
- The range of the number(X) is from 1 to 10^6.

# input & output
input(2) then output(1)
input(10) then output(3)
input(1000000) then output(19)
