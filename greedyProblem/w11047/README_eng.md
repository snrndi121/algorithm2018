# problem
- We have to change coins about a given number(K). There are enough coins(N) to change.
- Find the minmum number of coins to make the number(K).

# condition
- 1 <= N <= 100,000,000
- There are several coins units(A(i)). 1 <= A(i) <= 1,000,000
  A(1) = 1, A(i+1) is a multiple of A(i) (if i >= 2) )

# input
- the first line means the number of coins units(Ai) and the given number(K)
  After that, the coins units are given(1, 5, 10....)

line 1 : 10 4200 //Ai, K
line 2 : 1
line 3 : 5
line 4 : 10
line 5 : 50
line 6 : 100
line 7 : 500
line 8 : 1000
line 9 : 5000
line 10 : 10000
line 11 : 50000

# output
6
